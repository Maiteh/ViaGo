# ViaGo
Our final project for the bachelor in Interactive Multimedia Design. This is a webapp for tour guides and tourists.


## Reminder Working with git. 

Always work with the branches. <br />
Never give a branch YOUR name, name it after the feature your working on or something usefull. <br />
Only a fully working project that can be deployed may be on the master branch. <br />
Develop branch is for working features, every feature needs to be developed in a branch of the developement branch. <br />
Commit messages need to always start with Added, Edited, Altered, Fixed or Deleted, in English and end with a '.'.
